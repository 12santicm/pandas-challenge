-WRITTEN REPORT-

We are working on different data sets from schools that will help us understand how schools are managing their budgets and what types of performance are being obtain.

As part of our analysis we calculate key metrics such as the total number of schools, student population, average standardized test scores, and budget allocations. After this we generated a school summary where we break down analysis of every school, this facilitated the creation of data frames to evaluate and compare performance metrics, identifying the highest and lowest performing schools by percentage scores. Additionally with all this information we can establish different data frames to show performances such as the Highest performing and lowest performing schools by percentages, performances on each grade of High School as well as how they perform based on their school size and type.


As our first comparison, we can look at our data frames of highest and lowest performing schools by overall passing. Here, we can see that our highest performing schools are "charter" types of school, and the lower five schools are "district" type. With the data, we can conclude that the performance we are getting from charter schools is much better. Now, this does not have anything to do with the budget that these schools have. In fact, district schools have, on average, more budget per student than charter schools, so the difference in performance is a product of their governance, funding, and operational flexibility.
  
  We will focus on school size as indicated in our "scores by school size" data frame. The data reveals that small schools exhibit superior performance in terms of average test scores, followed by medium-sized and large schools. This analysis suggests that smaller schools achieve better performance due to their lower student-to-teacher ratios, allowing for more individualized attention to them. Therefore, both teachers and the schools can effectively address the needs of each student, which leads to a better overall academic achievement.
